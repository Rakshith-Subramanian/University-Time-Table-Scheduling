Greetings Sir/Madam:
 The project is done such a way that Lab sessions are assigned first:
 
First set of inputs will 
Semester(1-8)   (Enter semester in integer from 1-8)  eg 1
Section(A/B)   (Enter section in Upper case)eg: A


then please enter The day on which you wish to schedule your lab class(twice)
Monday or Tuesday or Wednesday or Thursday or Friday (First letter alone in Upper case)
eg:
Monday
Wednesday

the above loop will run for 16 times, so as to cover all 8 semesters and 2 sections



after the above loop,
please enter the total number of faculties you wish to schedule across all sem(in integer)  eg 10
then please enter the unique name of the faculty (in string)     eg: John
please enter the total number of subject handled by that faculty across dept(in integer): eg 3
	enter the sem name (in integer) eg  1
	enter section       (in upper case)   A
	enter the subject handled by that faculty for that sem and sec i.e 1A which is Sem1 sec A: eg Maths
	Hence John takes Maths for Sem1 sec A
	this inner loop runs for (total number of subject of indidual faculty)times
	Kindle ensure that each time you enter a subject for a faculty, please ensure that
	 *they are not in the same index of the priority list of the subjects which is mentioned in the top of code*
	eg :
		If Ramesh Takes 2 Classes
			i,e Sem 2 Asec and Sem 5 B sec:
				The priority order of the subject is  [7 hours,7 hours,6 hours,6 hours,6 hours]
					for sem2 secA  :			  ["C","Data Science","Maths","HSE","BEEE"]
					for sem5 secb :                 ["M.I","Computer Networks","ToC","Crypto","A.I"]
					
					hence C,Data Science,M.I, Computer Networks are all 7 hour subject per week for the student and rest are 6hr
						
					while choosing -the subject ensure they are not in same index and has same subject hour across all their subject handled
					i;e eg if Maths is chosen for Ramesh to handle Sem2 Sec A, then avoid "ToC" for Ramesh in Sem5 SecB and choose from "Crypto" and "A.I"
								Maintain this priority order for all faculties while giving their subject 
					ensure that the maximum number of class handled by the faculty is 3 if he is teaching 6hr subject else 2 for 7 hr subject
Thank you!
